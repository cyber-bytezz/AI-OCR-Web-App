## 11. Backend: FastAPI & Node.js Code Walkthrough

### 11.1 FastAPI Backend Architecture
The FastAPI backend is the core of the OCR system for regional languages such as Tamil. It exposes RESTful endpoints for OCR processing, retraining, and status monitoring. The backend is designed for modularity, allowing easy integration of new language models and preprocessing pipelines.

#### Key Features:
- **/ocr Endpoint:** Handles image uploads, validates input, and routes requests to the appropriate AI model based on the selected language.
- **/retrain Endpoint:** Accepts user corrections and new training samples, triggering the retraining workflow when a threshold is reached.
- **/status Endpoint:** Provides real-time feedback on OCR and retraining operations, including model version and last retrain timestamp.
- **File Management:** Uploaded images and correction logs are stored in a structured local directory, with automatic cleanup policies for privacy.

#### Technical Details:
- **Asynchronous Processing:** Utilizes FastAPI's async capabilities for non-blocking file uploads and model inference.
- **Security:** Implements CORS, input validation, and optional JWT-based authentication for advanced deployments.
- **Extensibility:** New language models can be registered via a plugin interface, supporting future expansion.

### 11.2 Node.js Backend for English OCR
The Node.js backend integrates the Llama OCR JavaScript library for English and general OCR tasks. It communicates with the FastAPI backend via HTTP or message queues, ensuring seamless multi-language support.

#### Key Features:
- **Llama OCR Integration:** Efficient text extraction for English documents using a transformer-based model.
- **API Gateway:** Acts as a proxy for English OCR requests, forwarding results to the main backend for aggregation and display.
- **Scalability:** Can be deployed independently or alongside FastAPI, supporting load balancing and horizontal scaling.

### 11.3 Raspberry Pi: Hosting & Retraining
The Raspberry Pi serves as an affordable, energy-efficient deployment target for the backend. It is capable of running both FastAPI and Node.js servers, as well as the AI model retraining pipeline.

#### Deployment Steps:
1. Install Python, Node.js, and required dependencies.
2. Clone the repository and configure environment variables.
3. Start the FastAPI and Node.js servers as systemd services for reliability.
4. Set up periodic cleanup scripts for storage management.

#### Retraining Workflow:
- User corrections and new samples are stored locally.
- When the dataset reaches a configurable threshold, a retraining script is triggered (via cron or API call).
- The updated model is evaluated using CER/WER metrics and, if improved, deployed automatically.
- Model versioning ensures rollback capability in case of regression.

### 11.4 Hugging Face Integration
For advanced deployments, the system supports integration with Hugging Face for model hosting and sharing.
- **Model Upload:** After successful retraining, the new model can be pushed to a private or public Hugging Face repository.
- **Version Control:** Each model version is tagged and documented, enabling reproducibility and collaboration.
- **Community Sharing:** Facilitates contributions from external researchers and students.

### 11.5 Backend Logic & Practical Challenges
- **Preprocessing Pipeline:** Includes denoising, deskewing, and layout analysis, implemented as modular Python functions.
- **Error Handling:** Robust exception management ensures graceful degradation in case of hardware or software failures.
- **Resource Constraints:** Optimized for low-memory environments like Raspberry Pi, with options for cloud offloading.
- **Security:** All endpoints are protected by HTTPS, and sensitive data is redacted before storage or transmission.

### 11.6 Educational Relevance for ECE Students
- **Embedded Systems:** Hands-on experience with deploying AI models on Raspberry Pi, including hardware interfacing and system optimization.
- **Networking:** Secure API communication, remote device management, and real-world IoT scenarios.
- **AI/ML:** End-to-end workflow from data collection to model retraining and deployment, with emphasis on practical challenges in edge AI.
- **Full-Stack Development:** Integration of frontend, backend, and AI components, fostering teamwork and project management skills.

### 11.7 Example Code Snippets
#### FastAPI OCR Endpoint
```python
@app.post("/ocr")
async def ocr_endpoint(file: UploadFile = File(...), language: str = Form(...)):
    # Validate and preprocess image
    # Route to appropriate model
    # Return extracted text and confidence
```
#### Node.js Llama OCR Integration
```javascript
const { createWorker } = require('tesseract.js');
// ... Initialize worker and process image
```
#### Retraining Trigger
```python
@app.post("/retrain")
async def retrain_endpoint():
    # Aggregate corrections
    # Launch retraining script
    # Update model if improved
```

### 11.8 Deployment Scenarios
- **Standalone Raspberry Pi:** For small-scale, local deployments in libraries or archives.
- **Hybrid Cloud:** Offload heavy retraining to cloud servers, with the Pi handling inference and data collection.
- **Educational Labs:** Multiple Pis networked for collaborative learning and experimentation.

### 11.9 Practical Challenges
- **Limited Compute:** Strategies for optimizing inference and retraining on low-power devices.
- **Data Privacy:** Ensuring user data is never exposed or retained longer than necessary.
- **Model Drift:** Monitoring and mitigating performance degradation over time.
